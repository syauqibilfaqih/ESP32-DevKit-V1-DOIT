A fixed version of 30-pin ESP32 KiCAD symbol and footprint by `@BlackCoffee` from the KiCAD forum

## A Brief Description

The original forum can be seen [here](https://forum.kicad.info/t/esp32-dev-ch340-c-symbol-and-footprint/56483/12). The preview sent by `@BlackCoffee` seems fine, but in practice, importing the files directly will return errors like what `@almond` got, since there was a misassigned footprint numbering somehow.

If there is still any problem in using the symbol and footprint, please don't hesitate to let me know.
